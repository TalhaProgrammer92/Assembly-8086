# Assembly Programs Repository

Welcome to my collection of Assembly language programs! This repository contains programs that I learned during my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) studies. All programs were developed using the EMU8086 emulator.

## About

This repository serves as a personal archive of Assembly language programs I created while learning the fundamentals of low-level programming. It's also intended to be a helpful resource for anyone starting with Assembly or looking for examples of basic Assembly concepts.

## Programs

Here's a list of types of programs included in this repository:

* **Normal I/O:** These programs contain basic input and output operations like taking a character/string as input and also display them.
* **Conditional:** These programs contain logical algorithms to solve basic problems like prime numbers, even odd, palindrome, reverse string, etc.
* **Complex:** These programs are more complex than conditional programs. These programs include a game, yes! Tic Tac game, and much more.
